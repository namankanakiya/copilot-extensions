# Reviewing Customizations

A repeatable review pass over the things that make a harness *behave* — its
skills, sub-agents, instruction files, hooks, and MCP configs. Run it whenever
you author or change these, and as the review step (Phase 8) of the
**`building-harnesses`** runbook. Unlike a one-off code review, this is scoped to
Copilot CLI customization surfaces and checks them against the authoring skills
this plugin ships.

## What to review

Gather the harness's customization surfaces:

- **Skills** — every `SKILL.md` under `.github/skills/` (and any plugin skills
  the harness authors).
- **Sub-agents** — every `.agent.md` under `.github/agents/` and
  `.claude/agents/`, explicitly declared repository-owned agent roots, plus
  agents shipped by the plugins enabled for this repo.
- **Instructions** — root `AGENTS.md` and any nested `AGENTS.md` / custom
  instruction files.
- **Hooks** — `.github/hooks/*.json` (or `hooks.json`).
- **MCP configs** — per-agent `mcp-servers`, project `.mcp.json` /
  `.github/mcp.json`, user `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` if it is relevant to
  the loaded session, plugin `mcpServers`, and any `agent-mcp` bridge configs.

## Method: mechanical scan, then design critique

Run the fast **mechanical scan** first to clear the machine-checkable violations,
then the **design critique** for the judgment calls the scan can't make, and a
**conformance cross-check** against the authoring skills.

### 0. Mechanical scan (repeatable)

Before any hand review, run the bundled scanner over the repo root — it catches
the checkable violations consistently so the human/sub-agent pass can focus on
design:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> [--json] [--strict]
```

Repositories that own agent definitions outside the standard directories name
each directory explicitly:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> \
  --owned-agent-root services/example/agents
```

`--owned-agent-root` is repeatable, repository-relative, non-recursive, and
limited to immediate `*.agent.md` children. Those agents receive the same
blocking ownership checks as `.github/agents`; absolute paths, traversal,
missing directories, and symlink escapes are rejected. The same roots join
`--context-budget` metadata accounting.

It reports (BLOCKING vs WARNING) on: **skill frontmatter** (`name` +
`description`), **name/folder match**, **trigger collisions** across skills,
**anti-recursion** (a Task-capable agent without an agent-specific
anti-self-delegation line), **agent manifest declaration** (a plugin shipping
`agents/*.agent.md` whose manifest does not declare a truthy top-level
`agents` field -- explicit is more robust than the runtime's implicit
`plugin_root/agents` default), **MCP readiness** (an MCP-owning agent without a
`## MCP Readiness` section), **agent-mcp fallback** (an agent-mcp-backed agent
without an equivalent materialized CLI fallback), **MCP plugin recovery** (a
plugin-packaged MCP agent without a discoverable troubleshooting skill, or
without an explicit dependency/prerequisite section in the plugin README),
**inline secrets** in config files, **raw IPs** in ssh/scp/rsync commands, and,
with `--from-settings`,
**session-start context composition**, including ambiguous stacks with more than
one possible non-empty output.
`--strict` exits non-zero on any BLOCKING finding, so it drops into a hook or CI
gate. It is a **heuristic aid, not a proof** — it deliberately under-flags rather
than cry wolf; feed its findings into the design critique, don't treat a clean
scan as a full review.

The ordinary scan also validates checked-in static instruction projections and
`.github/copilot/context-projections.json` offline. With `--from-settings`, it
uses the same enabled-plugin payload resolution as the rest of the scan to
compare each explicit `instruction-projections.json` declaration with the
checked-in result. Findings cover missing or stale projections, malformed
declarations/markers/locks, duplicate ids or destinations, conflicting
ownership, safely detectable `applyTo` overlap, orphaned lock/file entries,
legacy marked `AGENTS.md` regions, 4 KiB per-file and 12 KiB aggregate budgets,
and dynamic/session-specific content that cannot be checked in safely.

### Static fail-safe projection sync

Until the supported Copilot CLI version floor proves native composition of every
plugin-owned `sessionStart` `additionalContext` value, checked-in projections
plus exact-session guidance files are the reliable ambient-policy path. A plugin
declares a bounded, data-only pointer or fallback template and, when guidance is
dynamic, uses an output-free `sessionStart` hook to write the exact session's
file. Synchronize enabled declarations with the companion manager:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/manage-instruction-projections.py sync <repo-root>
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/manage-instruction-projections.py scan <repo-root>
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/manage-instruction-projections.py \
  scan <repo-root> --from-settings --json
```

`sync` reads committed repository settings independently of interactive folder
trust, then reads only the explicit declaration and canonical template from
each enabled payload (personal activation does not change a shared checked-in
projection). Malformed settings and unavailable enabled payloads block the
operation. It creates or updates only the declared
`.github/instructions/<plugin>/` destination, writes deterministic UTF-8/LF
bytes with machine-readable provenance, and commits all changed projections and
the deterministic lock as one serialized, compare-before-replace,
rollback-protected transaction. It refuses
unmarked files, malformed or missing ownership, different owners, local body
edits, nonportable or case-conflicting destinations, path escape, and
symlink/reparse indirection. It never deletes repository-owned files; orphaned
projections and old managed regions are review findings for a human or ordinary
repository change to remove.

### Session guidance conformance

For a complete migration rather than a point-in-time scan, follow
[`references/session-guidance-conformance.md`](references/session-guidance-conformance.md).
It has two modes:

- **adopting repository** -- update payloads, disable the retired authority at
  repository precedence, remove its config, synchronize every enabled
  projection, scan the settings-derived roster, and run blind launch probes;
- **plugin suite** -- classify every marketplace plugin, migrate dynamic
  guidance to exact-session writers, preserve static-only/output-free hooks,
  remove retired machinery, and enforce the complete roster mechanically.

The runbook also owns the later native-host transition gate. It never treats a
custom cross-plugin aggregator as a migration option.

The manager exits nonzero for every blocking conflict. Its `--json` result is a
stable versioned object for automation. A plugin remains independently usable
without this manager: its hook and skills do not import a sibling plugin. The
manager is the suite's reference consumer of the optional inert projection
contract.

Add `--context-budget` for a reproducible, counts-only inventory:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> \
  --from-settings --context-budget \
  --owned-agent-root services/example/agents
```

It counts Unicode characters, UTF-8 bytes, words, and estimated tokens using the
fixed heuristic `ceil(Unicode characters / 4)`. It separates always-loaded repo
instructions, nested/conditional `AGENTS.md`, standard personal Copilot
instructions, `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` payloads, enabled skill/agent
frontmatter metadata upper bounds, `additionalContext`-capable command-hook
registrations, prompt-hook registrations, and other hook registrations. Dynamic
payload size remains unknown by default; prompt-hook payloads are reported
separately and are not counted as `additionalContext`.
JSON output includes a stable `context_budget` object.

Add `--capture-dynamic` to also measure the real session-scoped
`instructions/**/*.instructions.md` files each plugin's `sessionStart` command
hook writes (see `docs/patterns/session-scoped-dynamic-guidance.md`), turning
the "unknown" additionalContext row into real byte/token counts:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> \
  --from-settings --context-budget --capture-dynamic
```

This runs only **plugin-owned** `sessionStart` command hooks (never
repository- or user-level hook files), once each, with a synthetic session
payload and a disposable sandbox `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` -- every facility
session-guidance writer resolves its session-state root via `Path.home()`,
so the override fully redirects the write; the real
`~/.copilot/session-state` tree is never touched, and the sandbox is removed
afterward. A hook that fails or times out is named in a per-plugin `errors`
list rather than silently reported as zero. Because it executes already-
installed, already-trusted plugin code (the same hooks a normal session runs
on every launch), this is a materially different -- and lower-risk --
operation than running arbitrary untrusted marketplace hooks; it is still
opt-in given it executes code at all.

The report prints paths and counts only. It never dumps instruction contents or
hook commands, and it **never executes hooks merely to measure them unless
`--capture-dynamic` is given**. The token
estimate is a comparison heuristic, not a tokenizer result; metadata is an upper
bound, and dynamic context remains unknown until runtime. The budget excludes
runtime MCP tool schemas unless an authoritative runtime measurement is
available. MCP configuration bytes are not rendered tool-schema cost and must
not be reported as though they were.

**Scan the plugin set actually LOADED for the repo — `--from-settings`.** Trigger
collisions are computed from both the structured `Trigger phrases include:` list
**and** inline prose (`Use when asked to "…"`) — a skill hides no triggers by
choosing prose. But the bigger blind spot is *which skills are even in scope*: a
harness that *consumes* plugins can mis-route when a **local** skill collides
with a **plugin** skill, and (for a repo that packages its own skills as in-repo
`.ai` plugins) the repo's *own* owned skills live outside `.github/skills`.
`--from-settings` resolves the repo's `.github/copilot/settings.json` (+ user
settings) `enabledPlugins` / `extraKnownMarketplaces` into the concrete loaded
set and brings each into scope:

```bash
# review against exactly what this repo loads (in-repo .ai plugins fully
# checked; external marketplace plugin agents advisory + source-classified):
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/scan-customizations.py <repo-root> --from-settings
```

- An **in-repo `directory` marketplace** plugin (e.g. `./.ai`) is *owned* — it
  gets the full frontmatter / name-folder / trigger checks, closing the gap
  where a repo's own `.ai` skills were invisible to the scan.
- An **external marketplace** plugin is *advisory*: its skills join the
  collision map (so a `LOCAL ↔ PLUGIN` clash is visible), and its Task-capable
  agents receive anti-self-delegation / MCP-readiness / agent-mcp-fallback
  checks. Plugins that package MCP-owning agents are also checked for one
  discoverable MCP troubleshooting skill and a README dependency/prerequisite
  section. Findings are warnings tagged with plugin origin, installed version,
  source, and the upstream contribution path because the consumer cannot edit
  the installed payload.
- When an editable `plugins/*` suite skill or agent matches an installed copy
  by plugin and item name, the editable source wins. The scanner does not
  report stale installed copies as external collisions or agent advisories.
- A Task-disabled agent whose explicit `tools` list omits `agent` / Task is
  exempt from the anti-self-delegation check. A coordinator agent is not exempt:
  it may delegate other types when authorized, but it must still forbid another
  copy of itself.

The same loaded-set pass inventories each active command `sessionStart` plugin
without executing hooks. It reports plugin identities and these roles only:

- **complete declared output-capable** — a complete declaration says the hook
  may emit context;
- **proven output-free** — a complete `context: none` declaration or a
  suite-standard exact-session writer/bootstrap/registration shape proves the
  hook does not emit model context; and
- **legacy direct or unknown** — no complete declaration proves the hook
  output-free.

Stacks containing only side-effect-only exact-session writers, bootstrap hooks,
registrations, and other output-free work are valid without a composition
authority. One possible non-empty output is also valid. More than one possible
non-empty result is BLOCKING unless the runtime version floor has a separately
proven merge contract for that event and field. An unavailable external payload
is a warning by itself, but joins collision detection when another possible
output is present. Reports never include hook commands, contributor argv, or
emitted context.

The version-1 `sessionContext` declaration remains useful as static proof that a
side-effect hook returns only `{}`. Existing output-capable declarations are
treated conservatively as possible non-empty output; they do not establish
execution order or composition. The current contract and the future native-host
composition seam are in `authoring-skills`'
[`references/hook-output-composition.md`](../authoring-skills/references/hook-output-composition.md).

Collision owners are tagged with their origin (`skill [marketplace/plugin]`).
(The older `--include-installed` / `--include-plugins DIR` still work — they add
a raw installed-plugin tree the same advisory way — but `--from-settings`
is preferred because it scopes to the *enabled* set, not every installed
plugin.)

**A finding that touches an external plugin is outside your repo's control.**
The scan says so, names the upstream `source` and version, and points at the fix
path. You can't edit the plugin in-repo, so choose:

1. **In-repo workaround** — reclaim the phrase with a local authority-override
   skill, disable the offending plugin for this repo, or narrow *your* trigger.
2. **Upstream fix** — file an issue / open a PR on the plugin's source repo. If a
   **`<repo>-harness`** plugin is enabled for that source, use its
   **`contributing-to-<repo>`** skill as the concrete fix path (for the
   copilot-extensions suite that's **`copilot-extensions-harness` →
   `contributing-to-copilot-extensions`**). This `<repo>-harness → contributing`
   hop is the **skill bridge**: it turns "this is broken in an external plugin"
   into "here is exactly where and how to fix it."

Some collisions are intentional (an authority override that deliberately
reclaims a phrase); judge each in the design critique rather than "fixing" it
blindly. And **never edit an external plugin's installed payload in place** — it
is overwritten on update; fix it in-repo or upstream.

### 1. Design critique (rubber-duck)

Hand the gathered files to a **reviewer** — the Copilot CLI **`/rubber-duck`**
critique command where available, a harness-provided review sub-agent, or an
equivalent independent reviewer. Ask it for **bugs and design flaws, not style**:

- ambiguous, overlapping, or colliding **trigger phrases** across skills;
- **duplicate or redundant** skills that should merge (context-budget waste);
- **ambient-guidance skills that restate standing rules one-shot** instead of
  respecting the authoritative owner — a skill whose body *is* a
  persona/style/safety rule meant to hold for the rest of the session decays
  after its turn. Repository-owned invariants stay in `AGENTS.md`; plugin-owned
  policy should be injected by the plugin as a concise context kernel; detailed
  procedures stay in the skill (see `customizing-copilot:authoring-skills`
  § *sessionStart context injection*);
- **contradictory rules** between `AGENTS.md`, skills, and hooks;
- hook or plugin designs without explicit context ownership and composition;
- Task-capable sub-agents missing the agent-specific **anti-recursion** guard,
  and MCP-owning agents missing readiness / equivalent fallback behavior;
- plugin-packaged MCP agents with no discoverable troubleshooting skill, or a
  plugin README that leaves runtime/plugin/authentication dependencies implicit;
- **footguns** — destructive commands without confirmation, hardcoded paths,
  raw IPs in SSH, secrets in config;
- instructions that tell the agent to *do* something no surface can express
  (e.g. expecting a hook to originate a turn).

Feed it the actual file contents (not summaries) and act on high-signal
findings.

### 2. Conformance check (authoring skills)

Cross-check each artifact against the skill that governs its format:

| Artifact | Check against | Look for |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Skills | **`authoring-skills`** | frontmatter (`name`, `description` with triggers), folder convention, description length, discoverable triggers |
| Sub-agents | **`defining-subagents`** | `.agent.md` frontmatter, bounded direct-execution contract, Task-capability, per-agent MCP ownership, anti-recursion pattern |
| MCP servers | **`registering-mcp-servers`** | registration scope (per-agent vs project vs global), config shape, env substitution, no inline secrets |
| Plugin registration | **`installing-plugins`** | repo `settings.json` (`extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins`), payload-vs-runtime, no "just in case" plugins |
| Instructions | this skill + `authoring-skills` | `AGENTS.md` is a lean map with repository-owned invariants/fail-safes; plugin ambient policy uses config-backed injection; declared static projections are locked, provenance-marked, bounded, and free of dynamic state; skills hold detailed procedures |

## Output and follow-through

Produce a **prioritized findings list** (blocking vs non-blocking), each with the
file and the concrete fix. Then:

- **Fix the minor issues in place** — trigger tweaks, missing frontmatter,
  format nits, obvious contradictions — with atomic commits.
- **Surface the structural ones** to the operator — skills that should merge,
  a missing anti-recursion guard, an instruction that needs a new surface —
  before acting, since they change design.
- **Treat external-plugin findings as upstream work.** Do not edit the installed
  payload. Configure/disable it locally or use the reported source and
  contribution path to fix the owning repository.

Re-run after fixes until the design critique is clean and every artifact
conforms.
